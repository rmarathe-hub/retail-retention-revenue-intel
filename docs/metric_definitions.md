# Metric Definitions

This document is the **source of truth** for KPI and analytical metric definitions. Each metric used in SQL marts or Power BI must appear here with definition, grain, and source table.

> **Status:** Executive KPI, revenue analysis, and **cohort retention** metrics locked through Day 7. RFM and revenue-at-risk planned for Days 8–9.

## Global Rules (locked)

| Concept | Rule | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Order** | `COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_no)` where `is_canceled = FALSE` and `customer_id IS NOT NULL` | Canceled invoices (`C%` prefix) excluded |
| **Customer** | Valid non-null `customer_id` with at least one non-canceled order | 5,881 customers meet this criterion |
| **Cohort** | Customers grouped by first non-canceled `invoice_month` | 25 cohort months (2009-12 → 2011-12) |
| **Line revenue** | `quantity * unit_price` (stored as `line_revenue`) | Returns net via negative quantity; canceled lines excluded from KPI revenue |
| **Total revenue (company)** | `SUM(line_revenue)` where `is_canceled = FALSE` | Includes guest/non-registered lines (£20,755,215.33) |
| **Customer-attributed revenue** | `SUM(line_revenue)` where `is_canceled = FALSE` and `customer_id IS NOT NULL` | Used for AOV, repeat rate, and customer KPIs (£17,685,460.64) |
| **Reference date** | `2011-12-09` | Last date in dataset; used for recency and inactivity |
| **Repeat customer** | Customer with ≥ 2 distinct non-canceled orders | 72.35% of attributable customers |
| **New vs returning revenue** | New = revenue in customer's first `invoice_month`; returning = all later months | See `mart_monthly_revenue` |

### SQL implementation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sql/03_kpi_definitions.sql` | Populates `mart_executive_kpis` (9 KPI rows) |
| `sql/04_revenue_analysis.sql` | Populates `mart_monthly_revenue` and `mart_customer_orders` |
| `sql/05_cohort_retention.sql` | Populates `mart_cohort_retention` (325 rows) |
| `scripts/run_kpi_marts.py` | Applies Day 6 SQL |
| `scripts/run_cohort_retention.py` | Applies Day 7 SQL and writes `cohort_mart_summary.json` |
| `scripts/export_powerbi_marts.py` | Exports populated marts to `data/marts/*.csv` |
